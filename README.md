## Some notes
Sometimes my ideas are confusing, and I don't follow PEP 8, so some code may not be understandable to you. If you have problems, you can talk to me or modify it yourself. If the following problems occur, please try to answer the following questions to find the cause:

1. Do you have the required modules installed, and is Python 3?
2. Check your configuration, especially the type of proxy;
3. Please ensure that the account password or cookies are correct and that the account is unrestricted;
4. Check the `doc.md` to find related content or Bing or Google related content.

If this does not solve the problem, please open an issue and provide information about the context, the possible code, the required module version, etc.

## Development Documentation
It is not finished yet, because the latest version is still not tested.

## What's the use
You can use PyWazi alone to develop crawlers, or you can use the module to develop other open source projects.
